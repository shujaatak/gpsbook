=== General ===

If you want to compile from source, you need a development environment installed.

First open the text file Gebabbel.pro. Locate the section of your operating section (# Linux #, # Macintosh # or # Windows #). Remove all '#' and the following blank from the lines in your operating system section. Add a '#' to all other operating system sections. Save and close the file.

Open a terminal window and cd to the directory containing the file Gebabbel.pro.


=== Linux ===

* Run qmake to create the Makefiles. Use Qt 4.3.0. Previous versions won't work
* run make to build the application
* Move the resulting binary called 'gebabbel' to a directory of your likings
* Create a desktop shortcut pointing to the binary
* Click on it


=== Macintosh ===

* Run qmake to create the Makefiles
* run make to build the application
* Copy a gpsbabel executable into the application bundle ("Show contents"). Choose the same folder that contains the gebabbel executable
* Move the resulting bundle called 'Gebabbel' to a directory of your likings
* Create an Alias on your Desktop
* Double click on it

=== Windows ===

You need mingw installed. While installing Qt4, it offers to automatically download and install it.

* Run the Qt4 shell as provided in the menu start
* cd to the directory containing the Gebabbel sources
* c:\qt4.3.0\bin\qmake.exe to create the Makefiles
* c:\mingw\bin\Mingw-make.exe -f Makefile to build the binaries
* In the resulting folder called 'release', remove all files except for 'Gebabbel.exe'
* Copy the following files to this directory:
  * c:\mingw\bin\mingwm10.dll
  * c:\qt\4.3.0\bin\Qt4Core.dll
  * c:\qt\4.3.0\bin\Qt4Gui.dll
  * The gpsbabel executable (gpsbabel.exe)
  * Libexpat (libexpat.dll)
* Rename the folder called 'release' to something like Gebabbel
* Move it to your preferred directory
* Create a link to Gebabbel.exe on your desktop
* Double click on it
