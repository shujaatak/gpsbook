=== V 0.1, 20061224 ===

Initial release. Released as a beta version, it remained as it is as no bugs have been known

=== V 0.2, 20070212 ===

* Changed source tree structure
* Internal rewrites and bug fixes
* Improved search for the gpsbabel executable
* Statically using the -p "" option so gpsbabel does never read a config file
* Improved presets, completely i18n'ed
* Split config files to user and system configuration so future updates will preserve user presets
* Improved option editing. Selecting an entry from the combo will be appended to the current line edit's contents and will not overwrite it
* Added options for all file and filter formats and options. Options are offered dependent of the format chosen
* Added help texts for all formats and options
* Disabling the process button if processing seems senseless (input file not found, no output specified etc.)
* Support for the realtime tracking option -T
* Disabling all checkboxes as soon as the realtime tracking option is chosen

=== V 0.3, 200707 ===

* Gebabbel now requires gpsbabel 1.1.3 or later, due to changing -s and -N to -Sn and -Si
* Minor adjustments
